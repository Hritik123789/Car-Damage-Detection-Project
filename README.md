# Car-Damage-Detection-Project
A deep learning–based web application built with Streamlit and PyTorch that classifies vehicle damage from images. The app uses a ResNet50 model to predict the type and location of damage (front/rear, crushed/breakage/normal) from an uploaded car image, providing quick and automated damage assessment.
